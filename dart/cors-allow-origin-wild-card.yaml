    message: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) allows a service to disable the browserâ€™s Same-origin policy, which prevents scripts on an attacker-controlled domain from accessing resources and data hosted on a different domain. The CORS Access-Control-Allow-Origin HTTP header specifies the domain with permission to invoke a cross-origin service and view the response data. Configuring the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header with a wildcard (*) can allow code running on an attacker-controlled domain to view responses containing sensitive data. For more information checkout the CWE-942 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/942.html) advisory.
