  - id: local-storage-without-cryptography
    message: Use of local storage without cryptography. While useful to speed applications up on the client side, it can be dangerous to store sensitive information this way because the data is not encrypted by default and any script on the page may access it. This rule raises an issue when the SharedPreferences and local-storage APIs are used.
